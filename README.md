# nullos

This repo is for building a modified (tuned for fast-boot & running love2d) raspbian-lite disk-image. This is fairly new, so it could probably use a lot of tuning.

You will need qemu and docker to work with it, but should be able to use our stuff without building your own, if you like. You can get help with the build commands that are available with `make`.


## TODO

- build love using retropie SDL debs
