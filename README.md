# nullos

This repo is for building custom debs & making a modified (tuned for fast-boot) raspbian-lite disk-image.

You will need qemu and docker to work with it.

You can get help with what commands are available with `make`.

This is fairly new, so it could probably use a lot of tuning.

## releases

We keep our build-artifacts in [releases](https://github.com/notnullgames/nullos2/releases).
