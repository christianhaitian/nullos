# nullos

This repo is for building a modified (tuned for fast-boot & running love2d) raspbian-lite disk-image. This is fairly new, so it could probably use a lot of tuning.

You should be able to grab the `img.gz` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/notnullgames/nullos/releases) and extract it to your >10G SD card with `dd` or hwatever you like to use to turn pi image-files into SD cards.

## development

You can get help with the build commands that are available with `make`.
